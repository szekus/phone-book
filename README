Welcome to the SmartGWT Demo PhoneBook Application
Author: Thomas J. Holmes Jr.    2012

Technology Stack:
MySQL 5.1
Maven 2.2.1
SmartGWT 2.5
GWT 2.4
Spring 3.1.3
Hibernate 4.1.4

This application is a personal project meant to demonstrate the CRUD abilities
of a SmartGWT/Spring/Maven project with GWT-RPC.  I know a Phone-Book isn't
super exciting, and it's certainly not meant to replace any other online Contacts
application.  I use Google GMail and Contacts myself.

I worked on my first SmartGWT/Ant with GWT-RPC project back in 2009
and that was a learning experience. When you go back and look at it, you wish you had done a
lot of things differently.  That may be a future project here.
The second SmartGWt project is with my current client, and they are doing things
a little differently with this application.
I think both of my SmartGWT projects have things to offer, so I am using some ideas from
both ... just the ideas, but not the actual code.

And I hope you find this app useful.
