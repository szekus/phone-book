FEATURES I LIKE TO ADD:
========================
1) When a user enters an email anywhere, it would be nice to verify that it is an email format, 
but I didn't bother at this point.

2) It would be nice to also enable Facebook Authentication, but that means getting the correct
Facebook/Java API.   There are a few out there, but not sure which ones work best.

3) On the signup form, when a user signs in, it does write cookies until the user chooses to Logout.
It would be nice to add the remember me feature so writing cookies becomes an option.
That way every time the user comes to the URL, they will be forced to sign back on again.

4) I didn't add the Admin tools.  So when a user logins as a USER they get one View
When the user logs on as the Admin, they get another view.  

5) Add the Admin features to allow changing to and from Admin to User status and back again.

6) Add the Admin features to allow adding, editing, removing Link, Email, and Phone Types.

7) Right now the lookup tables do not take into account Active and Inactive statuses.

8) I could rewrite this using JQuery and JQuery Widgets

9) I could write this using Node.js ... once I find out what this.

10) This could be modified to use the MongoDB, which is something I might do soon.
